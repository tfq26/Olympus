# Quick Test Commands for Chatbot

Copy and paste these into the chatbot to test log retrieval:

## ✅ GUARANTEED TO WORK (Based on your data)

### Test 1: Resource ID (Has logs)
show recent logs from res_vm_001

### Test 2: Resource Name (Matches olympus-test-ecs)
show recent logs from olympus-test-ecs

### Test 3: Partial Name Match
show recent logs from olympus

### Test 4: With Limit
show first 50 logs from res_vm_001

### Test 5: Different Phrasing
get logs for res_vm_001

### Test 6: Resource Name Variation
show logs from olympus-test

## 🧪 TEST VARIATIONS

### Try these variations:
show recent logs from ecs2
show recent logs from ec2-olympus
show recent logs from ecs
get logs for olympus-test-ecs
what are the logs for res_vm_001
display logs from res_vm_001
fetch logs for olympus
view recent logs from res_vm_001
list logs for olympus-test-ecs

### With limits:
show first 20 logs from res_vm_001
show first 100 logs from olympus-test-ecs
get 50 logs from res_vm_001
show 10 logs from olympus

## 📊 EXPECTED RESULTS

### ✅ Success Response Should Show:
- 📊 Found X log(s) for resource: [name/id]
- Status Summary: OK: X, ERROR: X, WARNING: X
- Recent Logs list with:
  - Status badges
  - Timestamps
  - Log codes
  - Messages
  - Customer names

### ❌ If You See Generic AI Response:
The router isn't catching the query. Check:
1. MCP server is running
2. Flask backend is running
3. Router is working (test with: node test in mcp-client)

## 🔍 DEBUGGING

### Test Router Directly:
cd mcp-client
node -e "import('./model/router.js').then(async m => { const result = await m.interpretMessage('show recent logs from res_vm_001'); console.log(JSON.stringify(result, null, 2)); })"

### Check DynamoDB:
python check_dynamodb.py

### Check Flask Backend:
curl "http://localhost:5000/monitor/mock/logs?resource_id=res_vm_001"
